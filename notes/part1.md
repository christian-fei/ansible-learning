The ansible management node could be a CI server, your laptop, etc.

- Host Inventory: listing of hostnames or ip-address you want to manage
- Playbook: configuration files that contain tasks to execute on specific servers


Ansible will play all the tasks for each group on the nodes in the host inventory.




Notes:
Take a look at "How Twitter uses Ansible" / "Fedora Ansible" on youtube..
